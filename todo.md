- [ ] having a default value in my config for `~/dev` should NOT mean that EVERY SINGLE FOLDER under that folder gets the same color. It should be that if I'm in that folder, then that's the color I see

- [ ] When I launch a new tab, it should be using itint by default. It is currently not doing that, but that might be because I did not actually run the curl command with the install script. Instead, I just used source /Users/michaelkoss/dev/iterm-tint/iterm-tint.sh

- [ ] When I make changes to the configuration, I don't want them to be cached and only loaded once I reload a new tab or start a new ZSH session or bash session or phish session, whichever terminal I am using.
